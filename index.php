                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What We Do ?</strong></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ceylon Electricity Board , A close scrutiny of the CEBâ€™s mission would reveal that the functions of the CEB encompass major human, social and economic aspects. The availability, reliability and quality dimensions certainly highlight the degree to which we should orient our functions to delight the customer. These are also the major concerns of commercial and industrial customers of CEB, which provide job opportunities to our people and to contribute to the economic and thereby the social development of our people and of our country.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The environmental dimensions encompass a mandatory requirement that the activities of the CEB should be to provide a clean and a green atmosphere where healthy human existence could be guaranteed. The affordable criteria highlight two aspects.  In the first instance, the commodity of the CEB, namely the electrical energy, should be within the reach of our people who could make use of it to catalyze the development of the socio-economic process.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This brings us to the second aspect, which is a major challenge to all the employees in the CEB. Our planning process, implementation strategies, distribution methodologies and revenue collection action should be geared to provide electricity affordable to the customer and to see that all these processes respect the availability, reliability, quality and environmental criteria.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">It is also important to realize that we should be able to generate sufficient cash to successfully provide the above processes and to have a reasonable internal cash generation to endeavor into future development needs.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Our Statutory Obligations<strong>Section 11: Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969</strong>It shall be the duty of the Board, with effect from the date of the transfer to the Board of Government Electrical Undertakings under Section 18, to develop &#038; maintain an efficient, coordinated &#038; economical system of electricity supply for the whole of Sri Lanka.<strong>Section 38: Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969</strong></p>
